# eHand

eHand is a Data-Centric, community focused,  Responsive full-stack website.

eHand allows members to create a post for some form of help that they need. It allows other members to respond by offering help
to the member who posted. Now the member who creates the post will also include the time/duration of the task, and this is important as is
also forms the means of payment.   

You see i believe the most precious thing we spend today is time - and to give that time to someone, freely - to help them out, is a 
wonderful gift. Now weve all been there - Someone helps you out - you maybe offer them money as you want to show your gratittude - 
mostly it is turned down, with a friendly - get me again!

Wouldent it be nice if you could give back what they freely gave - their own time?
Then they could go and use that time to get help they needed.

So therefore i came up with the idea of creating time on the site, as a token payment system.

To be included in the payment system - you must be a premium member, this requires registering for a eHand account and then selecting a type 
of membership required, free or premium:   

### Free Members:
Can login to eHand and view posts and offer their help and give it. But they do not have a Time account where they can accept 
Time as payment. They also cannot create posts.

### Premium Members:
Must sign up to the membership deal, which is â‚¬5 per month. This money goes to a charity organization and the user is then given 2 Hours of Time in their Time account.
They are able to view and create posts, and offer help to other members posts. They are also able to make and receive Time payments for work done.
