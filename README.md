eHand is a Data-Centric, Responsive full-stack website.  

**I really cant think of a greater gift - than the gift of TIME...**

This is a site where users can visit to ask for help, or provide it. Free members are able to browse a selection of notices by premium members and can offer their help.
Premium members can also offer their help and can also create notices - looking for any sort of a hand.   
Premium members can also use the sites unique currency - TIME as payment for any help provided. In doing so, you can give back what they gave you.

eHand will be submitted as my MS4 full stack project

# UX
## Purpose and Goals

eHand allows members to create a post for some form of help that they need. It allows other members to respond by offering help
to the member who posted. Now the member who creates the post will also include the time/duration of the task, and this is important as it 
also offers a guide to the amount of the TIME payment available.   

You see i believe the most precious thing we spend today is time - and to give that time to someone, freely - to help them out, is a 
wonderful gift.   

Now weve all been there - Someone helps you out - you maybe offer them money as you want to show your gratittude - 
mostly it is turned down, with a friendly - get me again!

Wouldent it be nice if you could give back what they freely gave - which is their own TIME?
Enabling them to use that TIME as a form of currency to purchase someone else's TIME - and get something done that they need?
Perhaps their car needs brakes fitted or their daughter needs help with her Maths - with TIME
they can get whatever it is they need.   

I really cant think of a greater Gift - than the gift of TIME!   

So therefore i came up with the idea of creating time on the site, as a token payment system.

To be included in the payment system - you must be a premium member, this requires registering for a eHand account and then selecting a type 
of membership required, free or premium:   

### Free Members:
Can login to eHand and view posts and offer their help and give it. But they do not have a Time account where they can accept 
Time as payment. They also cannot create posts.

### Premium Members:
Must sign up to the membership deal, which is â‚¬5 per month. This money goes to a charity organization and the user is then given 2 Hours of Time in their Time account.
They are able to view and create posts, and offer help to other members posts. They are also able to make and receive Time payments for work done.

# UI

eHand will use the Bootstrap framework to create a clean intuitive layout. The layout will be responsive having been built from a mobile first perspective.
The Navbar is floated down the page 200px as a default position - and will retreat to a fixed position at the top of the page allowing
content to dissappear underneath it when the user scrolls. The navbar will be almost focal, clean crisp and simple, with a lime green glow and gradient hover effect
reverting to the simpler ghost white when not being interacted with.

The logo and choice of colours was to achieve a nice contrast between a grey hand background image and the lime green colour.
The logo was designed with pastel type colours to make it visable when needed - but not to take over the page.

## Colours:
*   [Ghost-white(#f8f8ff)](https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8f8ff) - will be used for windowed areas.
*   [#555555](https://www.color-hex.com/color/555555) -  as the main font colour
*   [lime green(#c2fa00)](https://www.color-hex.com/color/c2fa00) - used in all areas for text, borders, highlighting etc.  


## Logo:
Designed by myself, plays on the name using distorted lines from a lowercase letter 'e', to form the likeness of a hand. 
The colours are a Kaki type [green](https://www.color-hex.com/color/6B7365)  and a pastel [indigo/grey](https://www.color-hex.com/color/656573)
to form the text part of the logo. The logo was created using [Paint dot net](https://www.getpaint.net/features.html).

## A Navbar:
Common to every page, the same navbar styling will be applied

## Information area:
Common styling of ghost white and grey font will be applied. Page headings when required will be in [lime green(#c2fa00)](https://www.color-hex.com/color/c2fa00)

## footer:
A common footer with social media links will also the bottom of the page.
