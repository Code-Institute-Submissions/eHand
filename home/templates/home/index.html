                <em>eHand</em> was born out of the experience of being helped in the past. Perhaps you asked a neighbour to put out
                your bin while you were away,
                or perhaps you got a friend to give you a hand with a bit of fencing. Whatever it was, quite often any attempt to
                reward this help is shunned, because
                they just want to help out and thats great. And often in my experience, throwing money around often leads to an
                awkwardness that complicates the issue.
